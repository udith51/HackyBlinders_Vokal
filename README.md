#### ⭐ What was our motivation?

>As technology advances, we often aim for newer and better approaches for solving problems leaving behind the orthodox methods. We now have technologies and API's that can work excellent as a translator from one language to another. For instance: Google Translator provides an awesome solution to the language barrier and we can use it very easily to communicate with some person with absolutely no knowledge about their language. But a speech-disabled person doesn't get a lot of benifits in this regard with the technologies available. There are no such proper service or website available that works as a translator for the MUTE i.e. a service that understands the sign language and converts it into user understandable form. So here was our motivation to build this project - **VOKAL- Giving voice to the muted**.

#### ⭐ Details of our Project

- We built this project to remove the language barrier between any person who is mute and a normal person who does not understand sign langauge so well.
- Our project is built on **Hand Pose Detection using Machine Learning**.
- Using this website any person who is MUTE can speek using sign language.
- Our project uses Hand gesture detection and responds with text accordingly.Further the website speaks the sign langauge predicted. Thus solving the problem.
